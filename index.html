    <h1>Jon R. Armstrong</h1>

    <h2>Welcome to this biography.</h2>
    
    <h3>In the Beginning</h3>
        <p>Jon (he/him) was born and raised in Sacramento, California. Jon is not short for Johnathan. Jon was born a little early and his parents Don and Jill didn't have a name picked out yet. In a pinch they ended up taking the 'J' off Jill and the 'on' off Don and mashing them together decades before this would become a tabloid trend for celebrity relationship gossip. Jon is the oldest of four children. Jon has one sister and two brothers.

        </p>
    <h3>And then</h3>
        <p>Jon had an arguably normal suburban childhood. He didn't get along particularly well with the classic educational systems however and changed schools frequently. At the beginning of his senior year Jon completed a state high school proficiency so he could leave the high school environment and started junior college. The standard college environment also didn't fit Jon too well. (Why does homework even exist?) While at junior college Jon spent a little time taking architecture classes but eventually put most of his energy into computer science. Working through environments like Radio Shack, Sprint, the headquarters for the California Department of Motor Vehicles, and Intel and jugging an equal number of relationships, Jon never really excelled in the community college environment. Eventually Jon completed his Associates of Art in General Education.

        </p>
    <h3>And then</h3>
        <p>The recession of 2008 was well on its way when Jon was finally searching for work with his new AS. Unable to find work and relying on friends and family for assistance Jon considered joining the Airforce. Through a number of twists of fate he instead ended up enlisting in the Marine Corps. Happy to have food and shelter and a steady paycheck Jon did quite well in the demanding Marine Corps environment. After boot camp and combat training he was then formally trained in Telephone Communications. Incidentally he was also trained to operate HMMWVs, and MTVRs. Jon had some pretty lucky rolls in the service and received orders to Okinawa for two years right out of trade school. Immediately before leaving Jon married a friend that had just been declared a second class citizen by the state of California and forbidden from marrying anyone of her choosing (because that was bs).  Jon spent a few weeks on mainland Japan after the Fukushima incident attempting to offer assistance and a months training out in South Korea and in Bahrain. His remaining service was spent in garrison in Southern California. Jon left active duty as a Corporal.

        </p>
    <h3>And then</h3>
        <p>Upon completing his active service contract, Jon returned to Sacramento, California and started to use his education benefit to learn Automotive and Diesel Technology. Jon also drilled with a reserve unit in the Bay Area where he promoted to Sergeant. Eventually Jon discovered that he could obtain an Associate of Occupational Studies in the same program in the state of Arizona and moved to complete his studies there. While at school Jon worked as a RV Technician but started working as a mobile forklift technician immediately after graduation from the Automotive and Diesel Technology program.

        </p>
    <h3>And then</h3>
        <p>Jon loved the hot sunny climate of Phoenix, Arizona. With such favorable weather Jon had started running more and had even completed his first half-marathon. Unfortunately Jon watches too many documentaries about climate change and just couldn't plant roots in a place with such a grim future. Just before heading back home to California, Jon decided it might be enjoyable to try to walk across the country on the Pacific Crest Trail.  After months of planning and significant investments in rations and equipment Jon and a partner set off from the Mexico border to Canada.  An unmanaged medical condition kept Jon's partner from performing on the trail as well as had been hoped.  After a grueling 750 miles Jon's partner left the trail and returned to Arizona. Jon went on to finish a total of 1325 unique trail miles that year and returned to California.

        </p>
    <h3>And then</h3>
        <p>After so much time away Jon decided to explore planing some roots in California.  Jon sought employment as a Toyota Technician for which he had additional specialty training.  Some family difficulty quickly sent Jon on his way up to the state of Washington where his wife was on a path to become a Naturopathic Doctor.  Fearing his educational benefits would expire soon Jon took this move as an opportunity to try something different and started a program in Bellevue to become a licensed massage therapist.  Jon had only had two professional massages in his whole life before massage school but had no difficulty learning Swedish massage techniques.  Upon completing his program Jon successfully passed a national exam and became a licensed practitioner in the state of Washington.  Jon was never able to make Massage Therapy a career due to an overuse injury brought on by the culmination of stresses from massage school, the automotive industy, and the pastimes of rock climbing in the gym.

        </p>
    <h3>And then</h3>
        <p>A pandemic set in.  Jon continued to go to work as a Toyota Technician throughout the pandemic.  The pandemic was a grand time for reflections however and Jon decided that he did not want to find himself in the same situation when the next big pandemic happened.  Once while airing out his pandemic pontifications with friends a seamstress mentioned that she had set her life in a new direction by attending a local coding school.  Remembering enjoying what little he was shown of Basic, HTML, and C as a child of the 80s, Jon considered that a shift to software development may help him align with his new post pandemic priorities.  Jon quit his job as an Expert Toyota Technician a week before his 40th birthday and started classes for software development with Code Fellows.
