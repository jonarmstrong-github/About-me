This page was responsible for some suggestions my browser had about my code when inspecting the page.

### Reflections and Comments

I did some experiments in the code for each of the four questions.
After typos and syntax errors were resolved:
I was happy to discover that the case modifier could be arranged in multiple ways and still do its job.
I was happy that the comparison operators could be rearranged and reduced and still work correctly.

I took some code from the John Duckett text to greet the visitor differently depending on time of day.
Denis was the driver, Jon was the navigator. Created functions out of conditional statments.
